# Kickstarter Analysis

## Overview of Project
After her play *Fever* came close to the fundraising goal within a short period of time, Louise was curious as to how other campaigns did in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.

### Purpose
This analysis drills into the Kickstarter dataset to inform Louise how other campaigns did using a written report that utilizes data analysis and visualization

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
With this visualization, you can see that May is the most successful month to launch a campaign

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
In this visualization, goals under $5,000 have a better chance of success, followed by the $35,000 to $40,000 campaigns

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- One challenge was in making sure that all filters were properly set to ensure accurate data was being represented. This was avoided by cross checking the request versus the filters put in place before submitting the results.
## Results

What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. April thorugh August seems to be the best time to launch a Theater campaign with May being the top month.
2. October through March is not the best time period to launch Theater campaigns, December would be the worst month to try.

What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- Goals under $5,000 appear to be the most successful, followed by $35,00-45,000 goals (though there were far fewer campaigns).
- Having a goal of over $45,000 seemed to be the least successful campaigns.

What are some limitations of this dataset?

- The dataset stopped in 2017, so more recent data would help inform with a more up to date report.
- A subcategory of "regions" or "states" within a country may reflect a better understanding of what people prefer and where to market the campaigns.

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

- A table and a line graph on the Outcomes Based on Launch date to only include "plays" instead ot the broader parent category of "theater".
- A table that had columns of "Name", "Blurb", "Goal", "Pledged", "# of Backers", and "Average Donation" and filter to show only "successful" campaigns to see what were the more popular plays.
